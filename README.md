# urvashi_dataanalysis_engage
## I chose this project as I was always interested in data analysis and its features as to how a big dataset can be formulated by applying small queries.
## I have taken the dataset from microsoft engage sample data.
## It consists of queries on google colab which revolves around a large dataset.
## i have used remoteit local tunnel to host my streamlit app on google colab.https://n9lbm5e2m6nix.p19.rt3.io this is the link to access it.
## this is going to be active for 15 min after the website's last activity.
## IMP: but you have to open an account on streamlit to access the website so please do that kindly.
## so providing the access key and secret key too in the form of microsoft last submission.
## ACCESS KEY:JPDNJ4WD45KIYU5IBWWJ
