# urvashi_dataanalysis_engage
I chose this project as I was always interested in data analysis and its features as to how a big dataset can be formulated by applying small queries.
I have taken the dataset from microsoft engage sample data.
It consists of queries on google colab which revolves around a large dataset.
i have used remoteit local tunnel to host my streamlit app on google colab.https://n9lbm5e2m6nix.p19.rt3.io this is the link to access it.
this is going to be active for 15 min after the website's last activity. so providing the access key and secret key too in the form of microsoft last submission.
if you still have problem doing something just go to this youtube video to know everything for opening a streamlit website through remoteit.-https://youtu.be/O2enoygZwl4
